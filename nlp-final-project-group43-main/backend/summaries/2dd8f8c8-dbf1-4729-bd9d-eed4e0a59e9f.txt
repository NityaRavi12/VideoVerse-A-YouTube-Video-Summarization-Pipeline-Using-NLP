Random forest is a type of machine learning model that uses an ensemble of decision trees to make its predictions . The decision tree is an example of a classification problem, where the class labels are golf, yes, and golf, no . While they're helpful, decision trees can no be prone to problems, things like bias and overfitting . The more decision trees that I use with different criteria, the better my random forest will perform, because it's essentially increasing my prediction accuracy . Bias can occur when there is a certain degree of error introduced into the model .
